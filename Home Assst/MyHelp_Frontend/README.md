## Motivation

As we all know, in today’s world everything has gone online. Let it be grocery shopping,
ordering food, even colleges have gone on online mode. It is not wrong to say that
these online sites/apps have become an integral part of our life and have made our life
easier and more convenient. Everything is just a click away.
Online service providing booking platforms for day-to-day problems, for example, the
need for a plumber or an electrician, or even a carpenter is still an industry that is not
yet explored to its full potential. We just have a few companies who have their monopoly
in the market and send in their employees to provide services and their prices are also
not flexible. Due to COVID-19 and lockdown, many independent service providers have
no jobs and are not getting the price they deserve, moreover, these service providers
are not able to compete with these big companies, and customers also don’t have much
of an option when they have to choose a service.
Seeing all of this, we decided to make a website MyHelp to solve these problems.
MyHelp is a platform for both the local service providers and customers to interact with
each other for mutual benefits. It is an unconventional platform where the website acts
as a platform for service providers to sell their service at their own price unlike the
conventional form of service providing where the company actually employs people to
provide service. This will also be beneficial for the customers as they will have more
options to choose from and also more choices for the prices. Also now they don’t have
to call or find someone to fix things at their home, it will be more convenient for them
now

## Tech/Framework used

- MERN Stack
- Reactstrap
- Redux
- JWT Authentication

## Features

- The service providers after making an account could post in their jobs and a brief
description about it, for example, price, location, age, and other vital information
that will be also stored in our database to help the customer choose in a better
way.

- The user has to just make an account and search for the service they are looking
for, our site will display all the available options in their city.

- The website will also recommend the best option according to your needs and
previous reviews about the service provider, which will improve the experience of
the customer and would also act as an incentive for the service providers to
provide quality service.

- After the service is done, the customer would have to also provide the rating and
review for the service provider so that we can keep a check on these service
providers and provide the best services to our customers.
